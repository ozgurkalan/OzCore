SQLite operations helper classes
================================

SQLite operations are a bit tricky. In order to ease the SQLite related operations, there are two helper classes to assist. 

Mainly, only ``Sqlite`` class in ``sqlite`` module is used. The module and class separation is made due to better code managament.

All methods can be directly called from ``core``.

Example::

	from ozcore import core

	core.sql.read(...)


Sqlite Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. automodule:: ozcore.core.data.sqlite.sqlite
	:members:
	:no-special-members:

-----

ORM Class
~~~~~~~~~~

.. automodule:: ozcore.core.data.sqlite.orm
	:members:
	:no-special-members:
