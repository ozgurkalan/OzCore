==============
Qgrid extended
==============

Qgrid is a Jupyter notebook widget which uses ``SlickGrid`` to render pandas DataFrames within a Jupyter notebook. This allows you to explore your DataFrames with intuitive scrolling, sorting, and filtering controls, as well as edit your DataFrames by double clicking cells.

This extention includes helper classes to quickly integrate in the ``Module Core``. Also, Apps can inherit the ``Grid`` abstract class to detail views in Jupyter Notebook.

Qgrid Usage
===========


Basic usage is by calling from core:

.. code::

	from ozcore import core

	core.gridq.view(df, handler=True, minor=None)

For consuming abstract class in Apps:

.. code::

	from ozcore.core.qgrid.grid import Grid

	class MySampleClass:
	    ....
	    def grid(self):
	        # call grid's inner class
	        _grid = self._View()
	        _grid.view(df_slice=self.df)

	    class _View(Grid):
	        # inner class to inherit core > qgrid > view method

	        def __init__(self, cards=False):
	            super().__init__()

	        def _handler_view_selection_changed(self, event, qgrid_widget):
	        # ....  override handler

	        def edit()
	        # .... override edit
